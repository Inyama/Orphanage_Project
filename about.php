            <p>Children all over the world are growing up without the care, protection and guidance they need. SOS Children's Villages is there, working with children, young people and families to tackle this global issue on a local level.
            </p>
            <p>We work to keep families together, provide alternative care when needed, support young people on their path to independence, and advocate for the rights of children. Together with donors, partners, communities and governments, we lay the foundations for a brighter future.</p>

            <h2><span class="primary-text">What </span>We Do</h2>
            <p>When children can no longer live with their families, we work with communities and state partners to provide children with loving and supportive alternative care.

                We work with children, families, communities and states to prevent family breakdown and ensure that children's rights are met.</p>
            <p>We work to provide quality care for children who can no longer live with their parents. We are committed to ensuring the highest standards of care in our programmes and work with governments and communities to improve alternative child care systems.</p>
