                        <h3>Quality alternative care</h3>
                        <p>Every child has the right to quality care. Quality care means a safe and caring environment for each child to grow and reach their full potential. We work with families to prevent family breakdown and with communities and states to provide a loving and supporting family environment for children who need alternative care.</p>
                        <p>We work to provide quality care for children who can no longer live with their parents. We are committed to ensuring the highest standards of care in our programmes and work with governments and communities to improve alternative child care systems.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Advocate for children's rights</h3>
                        <p>Childrenâ€™s rights are laid out in international, regional and national frameworks that establish the fundamental rights each child has. Children in alternative care are particularly vulnerable. We take action to amplify their voices and bring them to the forefront of policy and decision-making, working with states and partners to help ensure that children who have lost parental care or risk losing it are protected, cared for and empowered and that their rights are respected.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Protect children in emergencies</h3>
                        <p>Children are particularly vulnerable during humanitarian emergencies. In such situations, we put the protection of children and their families at the centre of our actions.</p>
                        <p>In situations of war and disaster, children need specific protection and care. With our established global infrastructure, network of partners and trusted recognition as a reliable partner in quality care, we launch emergency response programmes for children and families who need urgent assistance. Our emergency response teams have helped children at risk in more than 160 humanitarian situations around the world.</p>
